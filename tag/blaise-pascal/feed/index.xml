<p>Today we want to talk about a quote that really resonated with us recently. It&#8217;s from Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician, physicist and theologian who lived in the 17th century. He said: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;You always admire what you really don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p><cite>Blaise Pascal</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the quote mean?</h2>



<p>What does this quote mean to you? To us, it means that we tend to respect the things that are mysterious, complex or unknown to us. We admire them because they challenge our curiosity and imagination. They make us wonder how they work, what they are made of, what their purpose is. They also make us feel humble and awe-struck by the vastness and diversity of the world.</p>



<p>Think about it. How many times have you admired something that you didn&#8217;t fully understand? Maybe it was a piece of art, a scientific discovery, a foreign culture, a historical event, a person&#8217;s talent or personality. Maybe it was something as simple as a sunset, a flower or a starry night. Whatever it was, it captured your attention and made you appreciate its beauty and mystery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A deeper look</h2>



<p>One possible interpretation of this quote is that ignorance can lead to admiration. When we encounter something that we don&#8217;t fully understand, we may be inclined to admire it simply because it seems mysterious or impressive. For example, a person who knows very little about science may be awed by the complexity of a scientific theory, even if they don&#8217;t fully understand it. Similarly, someone who doesn&#8217;t know much about art may admire a painting simply because it looks beautiful, without fully appreciating the techniques or meanings behind it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG/220px-Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Painting of Pascal made by François II Quesnel&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But why do we admire what we don&#8217;t understand? Is it because we are ignorant or naive? We don&#8217;t think so. We think it&#8217;s because we are curious and open-minded. We are willing to learn new things and explore new perspectives. We are not afraid of the unknown, but rather excited by it. We are not satisfied with the status quo, but rather eager to discover more.</p>



<p>And we think that&#8217;s a wonderful thing. Because admiring what we don&#8217;t understand is the first step to understanding it. It motivates us to ask questions, do research, seek answers, experiment, create and share; helps us grow as individuals and as a society; enriches our knowledge and our culture. It makes us more aware and more compassionate.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Pascal&#8217;s</a> quote also suggests that true understanding is necessary for genuine appreciation. If we want <strong>to truly admire something, we need to take the time to learn about it and understand it on a deeper level</strong>. This might involve studying a subject in more detail, talking to experts, or simply spending more time with the thing or the person we admire. By doing so, we can gain a greater appreciation for its complexity, beauty, and significance. In this sense, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding becomes a form of admiration in itself – an appreciation for the richness and diversity of the world around us.</p>



<p>So next time you encounter something that you don&#8217;t understand, don&#8217;t dismiss it or ignore it. Admire it. Let it inspire you and challenge you. Let it spark your curiosity and creativity. Let it broaden your horizons and deepen your wisdom. Remember, it is not advised to blindly admire something without putting in the effort to try to understand it. <strong>The more we understand, the more we can appreciate their beauty.</strong></p>
