That&#8217;s a pretty close gap!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top 5 reasons men use social media<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/computer-security.jpg\" alt=\"social-media\" class=\"wp-image-201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/computer-security.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/computer-security-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/computer-security-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/computer-security-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For what reasons why do men use social media? What are their motivations and goals? Here are some of the top reasons why men are active on social media:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. To stay in touch with friends and family<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the most common reason why men use social media, according to the survey. Men like to keep up with what their loved ones are doing, whether it&#8217;s celebrating milestones, posting photos, or sharing opinions. Social media helps men maintain and strengthen their relationships, especially with those who live far away or have busy schedules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. To get news and information.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men are also avid consumers of news and information on social media. They use platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube to follow current events, learn new things, and discover new perspectives. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/media\/pew-research-center-72-of-americans-use-social-media-consistent-over-past-5-years\/\">Social media helps men<\/a> stay informed and engaged with the world around them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. To express themselves and their interests.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men also use social media as a way to express themselves and their interests. They use platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok to showcase their hobbies, passions, and talents. They also use platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Medium to share their opinions, insights, and expertise. Social media helps men showcase their identity and personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. To have fun and be entertained.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men also use social media for fun and entertainment. They use platforms like Snapchat, Twitch, and Spotify to watch videos, play games, and listen to music. They also use platforms like Tumblr, Quora, and Goodreads to explore their curiosity, humor, and creativity. Social media helps men relax and enjoy themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. To network and advance their careers. <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men also use social media for professional purposes. They use platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Glassdoor to build their network, find opportunities, and showcase their skills. They also use platforms like Slack, Zoom, and Google Workspace to communicate and collaborate with their colleagues and clients. Social media helps men grow and succeed in their careers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surprising reasons on why men use social media<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only men are interested in what is happening in the world, and they like to stay updated on current events, sports, politics, business, technology, and more. But men also have their own reasons to use it, and some of them might surprise you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. To stalk their exes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you read that right. Men are curious creatures, and they like to keep tabs on their former flames. They want to see if their exes are happy, if they have moved on, if they have gained weight, or if they have found someone better. They also want to compare themselves to their exes&#8217; new partners, and feel superior or inferior depending on the situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. To show off their achievements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men are competitive by nature, and they like to brag about their accomplishments. Whether it is a promotion, a new car, a vacation, or a workout, they want to share it with the world and get validation from their peers. They also want to impress potential mates with their success and status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. To follow celebrities and influencers <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men are not immune to the allure of fame and glamour. They like to follow celebrities and influencers who inspire them, entertain them, or make them laugh. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/you-always-admire-what-you-really-dont-understand-meaning-blaise-pascal\/\">men always admire what they don&#8217;t really understand<\/a>. They also like to get tips and advice from them on various topics, such as fashion, fitness, dating, or hobbies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. To buy things<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media allows men to shop from their smartphones, tablets or laptops, without having to go to a physical store or a website. They can browse through products, compare prices, check availability and place orders with just a few taps or clicks. However, these platforms rarely have commercial campaigns or discount programs to attract buyers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. To flirt and date<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Men are always on the lookout for love or lust, and they use social media as a tool to flirt and date. They like to browse through profiles and photos of pretty girls, send messages and compliments, and arrange meetings or hookups. They also like to check out the online reputation and background of their prospects before making a move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To sum up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the top 10 reasons why men use social media. Of course, every man is different and may have his own unique reasons for using social media. The important thing is that social media can offer many benefits for men who use it wisely and responsibly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social media is not just for women.
