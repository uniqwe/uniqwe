Today we want to talk about Rihanna&#8217;s hit song &#8220;Stay&#8221; featuring Mikky Ekko. This song is a beautiful and emotional ballad about a complicated relationship that is hard to let go of. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the lyrics and see what they reveal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Rihanna: music video<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The music video of Stay is very simple but stunning, as it shows Rihanna naked in a bathtub filled with cloudy water, while Mikky Ekko sings in a separate bathroom. It captures the raw emotion of the song, as Rihanna looks into the camera with a sad and longing expression. The MV also shows some close-ups of Rihanna&#8217;s tattoos, which add to her personality and her story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"nv-iframe-embed\"><iframe title=\"Rihanna - Stay ft. Mikky Ekko\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JF8BRvqGCNs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Rihanna &#8211; Stay ft. Mikky Ekko MV (1B+ views)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The song starts with Rihanna singing the chorus, which sets the tone and theme of the song. She asks her lover to &#8220;stay&#8221; with her, even though she doesn&#8217;t know why she needs him so much. She admits that she&#8217;s not sure if he feels the same way, or if he&#8217;s just playing with her feelings. Acknowledging that their relationship is not healthy or stable, as they are both &#8220;broken&#8221; and &#8220;scarred&#8221;, she wonders if they are just wasting time, or if there is something more between them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Rihanna: meaning of the song<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first verse starts with:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-298\" width=\"461\" height=\"213\" srcset=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image.png 871w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-768x356.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Here we can see that the narrator is describing the intense attraction and passion that she feels for her partner. She is willing to take a risk and see what he has to offer, even though she knows he might hurt her. He challenges her to get closer to him, implying that he has something to show her that will make her stay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chorus goes:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-300\" width=\"575\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-1.png 920w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-1-300x167.png 300w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-1-768x428.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We bet you would want to hear Cristiano Ronaldo singing these lines (in next heading). Yes, CR7 is Rihanna&#8217;s friend and it is so hot listening to him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the core of the song, where the narrator expresses her confusion and ambivalence about the relationship. She feels like they are stuck in a cycle of breaking up and making up, and she doesn&#8217;t know if he truly loves her or not. Admiting that she is not sure how to feel about him, but she can&#8217;t deny the physical attraction and chemistry that they have. She says that he takes her all the way, meaning that he satisfies her emotionally and physically. She wants him to stay with her, even though she knows it might not be the best thing for her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A deeper meaning of the song<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second verse says:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-301\" width=\"492\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2.png 931w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2-300x94.png 300w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2-768x240.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Here we can see that the narrator is trying to convince her partner to change his ways and commit to her. She tells him that he is not living a fulfilling life by being selfish and taking advantage of her. She reminds him that love is not something that you can just take from someone, but something that you have to give back. By repeating the chorus, hoping that he will finally tell her how he feels and what he wants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"nv-iframe-embed\"><iframe title=\"Ronaldo Sings Rihanna&#039;s &#039;Stay&#039; - Cristiano Ronaldo Movie Clip\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hoEo5ytT26U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ronaldo Sings Rihanna&#8217;s Stay<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bridge goes:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-303\" width=\"462\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-4.png 762w, https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-4-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This is the most emotional part of the song, where the narrator reveals her vulnerability and insecurity. Maybe the reason she holds on to him is because she needs him to fill a void in her life. She then flips the script and says that he is actually the broken one who needs her more than she needs him. Blaming that he is blind to the reality of their situation and that he doesn&#8217;t realize how much he is hurting her. She wonders who is really giving up on their relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Rihanna: music producers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay is a song from Rihanna&#8217;s seventh studio album, <a href=\"https:\/\/uniqwe.com\/diamonds-rihanna-meaning-song\/\">Unapologetic<\/a>, which was released in 2012. It was co-written by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mikky_Ekko\">Mikky Ekko<\/a>, who also sings on the track, and Justin Parker, who also co-wrote Rihanna&#8217;s hit song Diamonds. Stay is a pop and R&amp;B ballad that talks about the temptation and the inability to resist true love, even when it&#8217;s complex and dysfunctional.<\/p>\n\n\n<div

reveal their vulnerability and honesty in their lyrics. He also said that working with Rihanna was the &#8220;most intense experience&#8221; of his life, as they had to finish the song quickly for her record. The song was also co-written by Elof Loelv, and produced by the same trio along with Kuk Harrell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The song ends with a repetition of the chorus, where the narrator expresses her desire for him to stay with her. However, we can sense that there is a hint of resignation and sadness in her voice, as if she knows that he will never change and that their relationship has finished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do you think of this song? Do you relate to it? Do you think Rihanna and Mikky Ekko did a good job of conveying their emotions? Let us know in the comments below.
