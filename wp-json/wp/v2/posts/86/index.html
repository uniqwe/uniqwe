All of these methods are commonly used in computer science: open addressing or linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, and cuckoo hashing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Techniques to handle bucket overflow in external hashing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>External hashing is a type of hash table that is used to store and retrieve data efficiently. In external hashing, a hash function is used to map each key value to an index in an array, which is called a bucket. Each bucket contains one or more records, depending on the size of the record and the size of the bucket. In some cases, it is possible for a bucket to overflow, meaning that there are more records than can fit in the bucket. When this happens, chaining is the most common technique used to handle the overflow. However, other techniques can be employed to handle bucket overflow in external hashing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will take a general look at each techniques other than chaining to handle bucket overflow in external hashing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Open addressing or linear probing: When a collision occurs, the algorithm tries to find the next available slot in the hash table and stores the key-value pairs in that slot. This technique ensures a better cache locality and reduces the number of disk I\/O operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Quadratic probing: This technique is similar to open addressing, but it uses a quadratic sequence to search for an empty slot in the hash table. This reduces the clustering effect that occurs with linear probing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Double hashing: This technique uses two hash functions to determine the next available slot when a collision occurs. One hash function calculates the initial slot, and the other calculates the offset. If the initial slot is already taken, the algorithm adds the offset to the initial slot and checks whether that slot is available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cuckoo_hashing\">Cuckoo hashing<\/a>: This technique uses multiple hash functions and hash tables. When a collision occurs, the algorithm tries to move the conflicting data to the next hash table using one of the hash functions. This process continues until the data is successfully stored or the algorithm reaches the maximum number of iterations.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.andrew.cmu.edu\/user\/bqiu\/img\/cuckoo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"383\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open addressing or linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, and cuckoo hashing.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these techniques are designed to resolve bucket overflow in external hashing without resorting to traditional chaining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the techniques that can be used to handle bucket overflow is called open addressing. In open addressing, when a key value is mapped to a bucket that is already full, the hash function is used to compute a new index that is different from the original index. This process is repeated until an empty bucket is found. The record is then stored in the empty bucket. The advantage of open addressing is that it can lead to faster access times than chaining because there is no need to follow a chain of pointers to find the record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another technique that can be used to handle bucket overflow is called linear probing. In linear probing, when a bucket is found to be full, instead of computing a new index and hashing the key again, the hash function is used to find the next available bucket in a linear sequence. The record is then stored in the next available bucket. Linear probing can be faster than chaining because there is no need to follow a chain of pointers, and records are stored in contiguous locations in memory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third technique that can be used to handle bucket overflow is called quadratic probing. In quadratic probing, instead of searching for the next bucket in a linear sequence, the hash function is used to compute a new index based on a quadratic function. This technique can help to distribute records more evenly throughout the hash table and reduce the likelihood of collisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a fourth technique that can be used to handle bucket overflow is called double hashing. In double hashing, when a bucket is found to be full, a second hash function is used to compute a new index that is added to the original index. The record is then stored in the new index. The advantage of double hashing is that it can lead to a more even distribution of records throughout the hash table and reduce the likelihood of collisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, while chaining is the most common technique used to handle bucket overflow in external hashing, other techniques such as open addressing, linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing can also be used. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of technique should depend on the specific requirements of the application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This artile has provided you with answers for the question Can you think of techniques other than chaining to handle bucket overflow.
